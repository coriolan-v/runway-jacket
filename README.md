# runway-jacket

For a airport-themed costume party I decided to dressup as the runway because of course I did! I've used a bunch of addressable LED tape and attached them to a grey jacket. I've soldered wires and attached them to an Adafruit Feather ESP32 MCU with a battery and a on-off switch on the ENable line.
